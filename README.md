Simple program that allows you to control Goku as he flys through the air and goes Super Saiyan!

### Controls: 
* Left/Right Arrows    - Move Goku left and right. 
* Up/Down Arrows       - Make Goku fly up and down. Wow!
* Space bar            - Go Super Saiyan. *Such power!* 
* E key                - Perform a short range kamehameha wave. *Kersplash* 




### Future Revisions: 
* [better]Collision handling with the floor
* More Super Saiyans!?!?!?
* Neat sound effects
